In the current market many numbers of telecommunication networks are available, and we have luxury to choose one of them according to our requirement. The increased number of telecom networks in the market has led to increased number of customers moving to another network. This has become very common problem in Telecom industry and we often come across such scenarios in our daily life and this is another factor effecting the revenue of the organizations. The main goal of my project is to predict churn of telecom data which is nothing but number of people leaving current network and moving to another company. I want to analyze the factors that affect churn which in turn would be helpful for companies in retaining their customers and in acquiring new ones. To accomplish my goal, I am planning to build classification and regression models, furthermore I would perform few Machine Learning algorithms, evaluate their accuracy, and then choose the best fit algorithm for the business.
